        <h1>This is a blog post about my day "today" - 08/03/2022.</h1>
        <h6>I put today in quotes, as of the time of making this, it has technically rolled over to 08/04/2022.</h6>

        <h3>The Start of my Day</h3>
        <p>My day today would likely be seen as uneventful by most. But as for how my days have been recently, I'd consider it at least <em>slightly</em> eventful.</p>
        <p>The day started with helping my mom grocery shop, as her back has been bothering her recently. Unfortunately, I had taken some nighttime aspirin last night, so when I woke up I was <strong>incredibly</strong> out of it.</p>
        <p>The grocery shopping itself was about as exciting as grocery shopping could be. We did pick up some rotisserie chickens from the store for dinner though, and they made for a nice, easy dinner.</p>
        
        <h3>The Unproductive Middle</h3>
        <p>Following that, I spent a bit of time just relaxing and doing a whole lot of nothing. My allergies have been <strong>horrible</strong> lately (part of why I took some aspiring last night). So as much as I wanted to work on some stuff (or even play some Xenoblade Chronicles 3), my eyes were so irritated I could barely see.</p>
        <p>For a bit I just kind of sat about on the computer, browsing through reddit a little and talking on Discord, but I was having troubled staying focused on account of <em>wanting to tear my eyeballs out</em>. So, eventually I just decided to lay down and watch some YouTube and rest.</p>
        
        <h3>The Productive Ending</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, resting didn't work since I was feeling restless. But fortunately, my allergy medication had FINALLY kicked in. So, I decided it was time to be productive, and got up and about and began working a bit more on The Odin Project.</p>
        <p>I had initially created a Xubuntu VM for it, but I really hated the window manager used in Xubuntu. Since my computer is <strong>strong</strong> enough (see what I did there? I really <em>emphasized</em> that word), I figured "what the heck", and just made a VM of the full version of Ubuntu 22.04 instead.</p>
        <p>The setup was pretty straightforward, but there were a few exceptions (albeit small ones). For one, the mouse scroll wheel was a bit "stiff" feeling. I solved this through the use of the handy little tool imwheel.</p>
        <p>Second, I was having some issues with using multiple monitors. It seemed like my mouse pointer was always slightly offset on the X-axis from where it should have been. My first assumption was that this had something to do with using monitors of different resolutions (2560x1440 and 1920x1080). I did some searching around for the general issue, and the main posts I found were some old ones stating certain old versions of Virtual Box Guest Additions had issues. But, during the process of looking it up, I toggled back and forth between full screen and not full screen in VirtualBox a few times, and <strong>suddenly</strong> as if by <em>magic</em>, it started working.</p>
        <p>With the environment set up (and I'm leaving out a few things, like setting up git, installing Google Chrome and VSCode, etc.), it was time to get to work. I had left off right at the start of the HTML portion of the course, and that's what I'm doing right now. <strong>Wow!</strong>. Just don't tell <em>anyone</em> that I completely glossed over the assignment section of this lesson and completed the next one before realizing "oops".</p>

        <p>Also PS there's a <strong>VERY</strong> sneaky HTML comment below this line...</p>
        <!-- I'm a sneaky HTML comment, hi! -->
        <p>And <em>another one</em> below this line!</p>
        <!-- Gotcha! I'm another sneaky comment! Wow! -->
