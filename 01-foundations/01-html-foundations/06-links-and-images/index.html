        <h1>There Was No Assignment?! Wingin' It!</h1>
        <p>As there was no assignment for this lesson (at least in the practical sense), I decided to improvise.</p>
        <p>The assignment mentioned reading up on the types of image formats used on the web, and gave <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/#image-formats">this link</a> for a good source.</p>
        <p>I went a little further, and just decided to take a quick glance through the Wikipedia pages for each (even though I already have a pretty good grasp on the differences between them). But if you'd like, feel free to read up on your own!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG"><img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/mochi-77c69d.jpg" alt="A JPG file of a cute animated face" style="width:100px;height:100px;">JPG</a></li>
            <li><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics"><img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/mochi-f95fdf.png" alt="A PNG file of a cute animated face" style="width:100px;height:100px;">PNG</a></li>
            <li><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF"><img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/mochi-961ee5.gif" alt="An animated GIF file of a cute animated face" style="width:100px;height:100px;">GIF</a></li>
            <li><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics"><img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/svg-vs-png-image-3df7fd.png" alt="An SVG file of a cute animated face" style="width:200px;height:100px;">SVG</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Boy, those offsets from the list bullet points sure are a bit funky. At the very least, adding a linebreak to the start made them a little better (before they were at the bottom, it was <strong>real</strong> ugly.</p>
        <p>But hey, if you noticed, I made the images part of the link. That's extra credit, right?!</p>
