# theodinproject

This is a repository for my work through the lesson portions of The Odin Project. Work will be broken down into folders titled for each section of the course. From there, each lesson with an assignment will have its own folder.

Work related to projects will be placed in their own individual repositories. As projects are begun, their links will be added to this README.
